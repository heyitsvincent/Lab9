### 70pt
Create a celcius to fahrenheit calculator. Multiply by 9, then divide by 5, then add 32 to calculate your answer.

### 85pt
Create a for loop that will search through temperatureList and create a new list that includes only numbers greater than 100

### 100pt
Create a program that tests if patients needs to be admitted to the hospital.
Ask the user for their temperature, and if they have been sick in the last 24 hours.
Additionally, ask if the user has recently travelled to West Africa.
The program should continue to run until there are no patients left to diagnose (i.e. a while loop).

Criteria for Diagnosis:
- A temperature of over 105F
- A temperature of over 102F and they have been sick in the last 24 hours
- A temperature over 100, OR they've been sick in the last 24 hours, AND they've recently travelled to West Africa.
